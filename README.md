# Agentic-Evaluation-Framework

Overview
This project implements an Agentic Evaluation Framework designed for large-scale assessment of AI agent responses. It addresses the need for systematic evaluation of agents across multiple dimensions such as instruction adherence, coherence, assumption control, hallucination risk and reference agreement.

The framework is rule-based and heuristic-driven, offering transparency and interpretability. It can serve as a baseline system and can be extended with machine learning or large language model (LLM)-based scoring.

Features
Multi-dimensional evaluation of responses:Instruction-following: Measures whether the response aligns with the explicit instructions in the prompt.

Coherence: Evaluates semantic similarity between the prompt and response.

Assumption control: Detects unwarranted assumptions and rewards controlled disclaimers.

Hallucination risk: Identifies potential fabrication of entities, dates or numbers.
